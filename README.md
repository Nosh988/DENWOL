## Brief Description

This repository hosts the Python code for `DENWOL`, a numerical mosquito population model. It utilizes Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to simulate the population dynamics of mosquitoes and the impact of *Wolbachia* releases in Nouméa, New Caledonia.

This model is a component of the larger project: **DENWOLution: Dengue et Wolbachia, Impact sur l'évolution génétique virale et le profil épidémiologique**.

## Current Status: In Development 

**Please Note:** This software is currently under active development.

The code within this repository, including the `DENWOL` model source and analysis scripts, is planned to be made publicly available **upon the publication of the associated research article**.

Once published, a link to a persistent archive (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare) of the specific code version used for the publication will also be provided here.
